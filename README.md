# Homemade MIDI
These are MIDI re-creations of existing music. I have no tools that automatically generate MIDI data from a sound file. I make these manually, by ear.
I usually use Mixcraft to make these, so the GeneralUser soundfont is most likely to give a good listening experience, but I try to make these soundfont-agnostic.
